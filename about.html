      <h2 class="about"> Collecting to Connect</h2>
      <p class="about"> One day, while living in Prague, Czech Republic, I wandered into an <em>antik</em> and found so many odds and ends—little treasures of all kinds. However, it wasn’t until I landed on a shoebox of old photos that I felt truly compelled to possess anything in the shop. In the box there were images that captured people from decades—even a century before—that felt so comforting and familiar somehow. 
      </p>
<p class="about">These highlights of distant lives were connected to the spirit of the city and country today—in a way that the countless postcards and souvenir paintings for sale in Staré Město and Hradčanská could never be. All of these images made me feel connected to the history and culture of the Czech Republic in a profound way. So I began collecting—seeking out every <em>antik</em>  I could find. 
</p>
<p class="about">When I returned to the United States, it was my collection of old photos, not the many modern shots I also captured, that I showed people as a way of sharing what I had experienced while away.  Now, when I travel to a new place I seek out the antique stores and dealers in ephemera to add to my collection.
 This project showcases a small selection from my Czech collection.
